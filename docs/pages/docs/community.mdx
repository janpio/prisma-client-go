# Prisma Client Go Community

Features and bug reports can always be reported via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/steebchen/prisma-client-go/issues).
I always look into bug reports, and try my best to fix these.

I host a private discord server for the Go client community. It is a place for deeper discussions, direct communication with me and plenty of other smart people working in the Go ecosystem.

[GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/steebchen) on _any_ tier get access to the community for free. When you sponsor me, you automatically get an invitation to the discord server.

If you contribute to the Go client, you get free access to the community as well. Just ping me [@steebchen](https://github.com/steebchen) in your PR, and I'll send you an invitation.

This helps keeping the discord bot and spam free and supports the development of the Go client.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  <b>Free and Open Source is king</b> The Go client itself will always be free and open source, including its issue
  tracker. The Go client community is just a special community for deeper discussions and premium support.
