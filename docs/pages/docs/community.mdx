# Prisma Client Go Community

Features and bug reports can always be reported via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/steebchen/prisma-client-go/issues).
I always look into bug reports, and try my best to fix these.

I host a private discord server for the Go client community. It is a place for deeper discussions, direct communication with me and plenty of other smart people working in the Go ecosystem.
It also supports the development of the Go client, and helps me to keep dedicating time for it.

[GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/steebchen) on $100/month tiers or higher get access to the community for free. When you sponsor me, you automatically get an invitation to the discord server.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  <b>Free and Open Source is king</b> The Go client itself will always be free and open source, including its issue
  tracker. The Go client community is just a special community for deeper discussions and premium support; plus it
  helps me to keep working on the Go client.
</Callout>

The first <b>50</b> signups will get a <b>70%</b> early bird discount on the community membership price of <b>$99</b>. It's a one time payment for a <b>lifetime</b> membership. While the Go client is in alpha/beta and after all early bird memberships are sold out, there is going to be a <b>20%</b> discount. Once the Go client is production ready, the price will be <b>$99</b>.
